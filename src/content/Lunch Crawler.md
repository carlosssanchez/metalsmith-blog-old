# Lunch Crawler

# Idea:
Crawl Facebook and local WhatsApp groups for daily menus. Build list of food available by location.

User: Can use app or web page to search by food desired and find nearest options.

Users will need to sign up to receive daily menu (email with ads).

Lunch and Dinner separate features. Also "roulette" option when you can't decide.

Feature: User can enter food allergies and manually mark food they are allergic to.

Business: hook up with companies that offer week-packs of food in bulk. Cocina Selecta style.
